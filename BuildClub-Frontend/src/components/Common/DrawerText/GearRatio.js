        A big single-speed gear ratio (1:10) prioritizes higher top speeds and
        efficiency at high speeds but sacrifices acceleration. A small
        single-speed gear ratio (1:6) prioritizes quicker acceleration and
        efficiency at low speeds but limits the vehicle's top speed.

        A gear ratio may be already defined by the choice of gear-train in the
        vehicle. However, it is possible to modify it to customize the
        performance of the vehicle.
