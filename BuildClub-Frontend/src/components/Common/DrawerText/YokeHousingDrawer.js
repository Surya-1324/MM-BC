        It is a measure of the effectiveness of conductive heat transfer between a stator yoke and
        motor housing. Its value could be as low as 375 W/(m2K) for a stator that is merely
        pressed into the housing bore. It could be as high as 25000 W/(m2K) if the housing is shrink-
        fitted around the stator.
