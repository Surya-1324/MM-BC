        Electrical steels are designed to have advantageous magnetic properties, including 
        high magnetic permeability and low core loss, essential for effective performance in an 
        electric motor. The designation "M250" specifies the magnetic characteristics of the steel, 
        with a core loss of 235 W/kg at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T for a frequency of 50 Hz. 
        Meanwhile, "35A" denotes the thickness of the magnetic steel lamination, at 0.35mm. 
        M250 35A steel is chosen for its capacity to conduct magnetic flux efficiently and reduce 
        energy losses.

      <h3>Gross Vehicle Weight(kg)</h3><br>
      <p>It is the “total” weight of the vehicle, which includes the kerb weight and the payload.</p>
      <p>Kerb weight: This is the bare vehicle weight including that of its power-train 
          (motor, batteries etc.)</p>
      <p>Payload: This includes the maximum weight of passengers and cargo that the 
          vehicle is designed to carry.</p>
      <p>In the case of a 2-wheeler, the kerb weight is around 100-200 kgs. The payload includes 
          the total weight of two passengers and luggage – usually estimated at 160Kg.</p>
      <p>In the case of a 4-wheeler, the kerb weight can be chosen in the following range 
          depending upon the application in addition to the weight of the passengers.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Subcompact cars: 1,000 kg - 1,500 kgs</li>
          <li>Compact cars: 1,200 kg - 1,800 kgs</li>
          <li>Midsize sedans: 1,400 kg - 2,000 kgs</li>
          <li>SUVs and crossovers: 1,500 kg - 2,500 kgs depending on size and purpose.</li>
      </ul>
