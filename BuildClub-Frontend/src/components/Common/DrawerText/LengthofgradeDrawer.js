        the vehicle is expected to cover a length of 15m plus its wheelbase, on fully loaded condition
        (max GVW), to demonstrate its gradeability. The vehicle should start from rest and cover the
        specified distance without any stops on the way.

        The wheelbase of 2 and 3 wheelers is generally 2m. The wheelbase for a four-wheeler
